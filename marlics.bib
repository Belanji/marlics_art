abstract = {A continuum theory is used to study ordering in liquid crystal nanodroplets. The free energy functional that describes the system is minimized using an Euler-Lagrange approach and an unsymmetric radial basis function method. The equilibrium morphology in nanodroplets is shown to represent a delicate balance between bulk and surface contributions; when the radius of the droplet reaches a critical value, that balance is altered and the droplet undergoes a transition. By controlling the anchoring conditions at the droplet's surface, one can control the radius where the transition occurs and even prepare metastable droplets where small perturbations can trigger a morphological transition. The results of the theory are shown to be consistent with recent experimental observations on monodisperse nematic liquid crystal nanodroplets. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Imaging techniques are essential tools for inquiring a number of properties from different materials. Liquid crystals are often investigated via optical and image processing methods. In spite of that, considerably less attention has been paid to the problem of extracting physical properties of liquid crystals directly from textures images of these materials. Here we present an approach that combines two physics-inspired image quantifiers (permutation entropy and statistical complexity) with machine learning techniques for extracting physical properties of nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals directly from their textures images. We demonstrate the usefulness and accuracy of our approach in a series of applications involving simulated and experimental textures, in which physical properties of these materials (namely: average order parameter, sample temperature, and cholesteric pitch length) are predicted with significant precision. Finally, we believe our approach can be useful in more complex liquid crystal experiments as well as for probing physical properties of other materials that are investigated via imaging techniques.},

@article{Bezic1992,
abstract = {Model structures of cholesteric liquid crystal droplets embedded in a medium which enforces parallel surface anchoring are treated. Structures with disclination lines of integer and half-integer strength are obtained by minimising the Frank free energy. The constant order parameter approximation appropriate for droplets which are large compared to the cores of defects and the approximate ansatz with the molecular director everywhere tangential to the concentric spherical surfaces are used. Within this approach the structure with a diametrical disclination line is the most stable. Its free energy is compared to that of the non-twisted bipolar structure and to that of the two twisted structures. The well-known structure with a radial disclination line and that with a double radial disclination line not found in the known literature are presented. It is shown that surface free energy terms, usually omitted in the minimization, do not influence substantially the stability of the structures discussed. The phase diagram is constructed and the theoretical predictions are compared with available experimental results. Further an approximate description of a possible director field escape close to the defect lines is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1992 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Frustration of chiral ordering is explored in cholesteric liquid crystal droplets with planar degenerate anchoring using numerical modeling. Droplets of variable pitches are studied, demonstrating the role of a gradually increasing cholesteric pitch and the corresponding equilibrium structures. All previously known structures are identified but with notable differences. The structures presented with director fields are complemented with a detailed description of the defect regions. The characteristic half- diameter +2 disclination from previous studies is found to be in fact a double-helix of two {\{}lambda{\}}+1 disclination lines, whereas the full-diameter +1 disclination is composed of an alternating series of {\{}tau{\}}-1/2 and {\{}lambda{\}}+1/2 disclination rings. Finally, two new meta-stable cholesteric structures -Lyre and Yeti- are found, which are characterised by complex compositions of cholesteric disclinations.},

@article{Sussman2019,
abstract = {Numerical modeling of nematic liquid crystals using the tensorial Landau-de Gennes (LdG) theory provides detailed insights into the structure and energetics of the enormous variety of possible topological defect configurations that may arise when the liquid crystal is in contact with colloidal inclusions or structured boundaries. However, these methods can be computationally expensive, making it challenging to predict (meta)stable configurations involving several colloidal particles, and they are often restricted to system sizes well below the experimental scale. Here we present an open-source software package that exploits the embarrassingly parallel structure of the lattice discretization of the LdG approach. Our implementation, combining CUDA/C++ and OpenMPI, allows users to accelerate simulations using both CPU and GPU resources in either single- or multiple-core configurations. We make use of an efficient minimization algorithm, the Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine (FIRE) method, that is well-suited to large-scale parallelization, requiring little additional memory or computational cost while offering performance competitive with other commonly used methods. In multi-core operation we are able to scale simulations up to supra-micron length scales of experimental relevance, and in single-core operation the simulation package includes a user-friendly GUI environment for rapid prototyping of interfacial features and the multifarious defect states they can promote. To demonstrate this software package, we examine in detail the competition between curvilinear disclinations and point-like hedgehog defects as size scale, material properties, and geometric features are varied. We also study the effects of an interface patterned with an array of topological point-defects.},

Our method is computationally easy to implement, balancing requirements of efficiency and accuracy. We benchmark our method through the study of the following problems: the isotropic-nematic interface, growth of nematic droplets in the isotropic phase and the kinetics of coarsening following a quench into the nematic phase. Our results, obtained through solutions of the full coarse-grained equations of motion with no approximations, provide a stringent test of the de Gennes ansatz for the isotropic - nematic interface, illustrate the anisotropic character of droplets in the nucleation regime and validate dynamical scaling in the coarsening regime.},
